# deadbolt-2-java-global-state

All global state-based elements have been removed from Deadbolt 2.6.  To ease migration, they are still available through this drop-in library.

To use it, add ´"be.objectify" %% "deadbolt-java-gs" % "2.6.0"´ to your build.  See [the documentation](https://deadbolt-java.readme.io/docs/template-constraints#section-global-state-vs-dependency-injection-in-templates) for further details.
